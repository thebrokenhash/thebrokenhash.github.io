	I am Kirti Vardhan Rathore, 21 years old, an engineer with a knack for design, quite inspired to make good art. I do not claim to be a story teller but wish I could tell one. No matter how calm and composed a person's life seems, there's always a time in the past when they reached an impasse. A time when they went a little crazy. I guess people need that sort of stage in their lives, and I am in that phase of my life, and I do not know when it will get over.

			<p>	I knew a guy once, nobody wanted his glance, his face like the one which nobody wants to remember, so nobody does. With untidy and longhairs, messed up dirty beard and turbulent flow of dark lines around his eyes, he was pet- named as Beast, among a few who remembered that face of his.</p>
			<p>He carried no camera, no paint brushes, no creative suits installed machines, he was never seen dancing, never seen practicing vocals. He was just seen sitting alone doing nothing, staring at nothingness. But, Beast was an artist. Artist of the art which nobody could see or to be precise nobody wanted to and thereby no one can appreciate.</p>
			<p>Sometimes he sat on the river banks legs dipped in water till knees, water curling around them and he, listening to chirruping birds, rustling trees and the sound of his piece of art in making. But most of the times he was seen alone, standing somewhere, feeling the air tracing his outline. He spent his nights looking at the stars and ultimately falling asleep under that sheet of galaxies.</p>
			<p>He noticed people unknowingly making the same kind of art as his, some in a hurry, some in a clumsy way, some even more beautiful than his and some even worse than his own appearance. But he was not in any competition, not in a hurry because he had forever to complete his only piece of art.</p>
			<p>He was an Artist and he was busy creating his soul.</p>
